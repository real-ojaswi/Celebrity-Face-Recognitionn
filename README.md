The repository contains the code developed to perform celebrity face recognition on the [subset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J-gnuvPoanMfM52RTY2IpdHOaVL36L3e/view) of [Celebrity Face Recognition Dataset](https://github.com/prateekmehta59/Celebrity-Face-Recognition-Dataset). Finetuning of several models were performed. Given the imbalance and noise in the dataset sample reweighing was performed as described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09050). The overall accuracy of 86.18% was obtained which was the highest for the competiion.
