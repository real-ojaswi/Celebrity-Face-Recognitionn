The repository contains the code developed to perform celebrity face recognition on the [subset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J-gnuvPoanMfM52RTY2IpdHOaVL36L3e/view) of [Celebrity Face Recognition Dataset](https://github.com/prateekmehta59/Celebrity-Face-Recognition-Dataset). First the faces were cropped from the image using [MTCNN](https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch). Several models were finetuned on the cropped dataset. Given the imbalance and noise in the dataset sample reweighing was performed as described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09050). The predictions from these models were ensembled using *combined_predict.py* to get the final result. The overall accuracy of 86.18% was obtained which was the highest for the competiion.
